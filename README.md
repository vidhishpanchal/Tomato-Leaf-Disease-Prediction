# Crop_disease_Prediction

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saroz014/plant-disease

Objective:
`The objective of this project is to provide an application which predicts the type of crop disease based on textural similarity of leaves. Publicly available dataset containing healthy and diseased crop leaves is used to train the model. The early diagnosis of crop disease can be used to prevent further damage that could happen to the crops thus helping for sustaining the cultivation.`

In this Project, I have used pre-defined training model "Inception V3" for training the dataset and the accuracy for this model is 0.9595 ~ 95.95% accurate for training data and validation_Accuracy is 0.9410 ~ 94.10%. This project can Classify total 10 Classes where 9 classes are different tomato crop diseases i.e (Bacterial_spot, Early_blight, Late_blight, Leaf_Mold, Septoria_leaf_spot, Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite, Target_Spot, Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus, Tomato_mosaic_virus) and 1 class is Healthy crop class. In the Dataset there are many different crops disease classes but my focus was to cover only Tomato Disease Crops as I had insufficient Resources to work on large no of Dataset for now. In future I will try to build model for classifying all the crop disease given in the dataset.

Here, I have the attached the Output of this project.
